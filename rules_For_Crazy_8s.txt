-------------Basic Instructions For Crazy 8's-------------
When playing cards from your hand.
They must either match the suit, or the face value of the card on top of the discard pile.
When you play an 8, it may be of any suit.  Upon playing it you must declare the new suit for the pile.
The game continues until the deck of cards is exhausted or a player plays their last card.
At that point your remaining hand(if any) are tallied up as follows;
Ace: 1 Point, 2-7 and 9: face value of Points(2 for a 2 etc...),10-King: 10 Points, and an 8: 50 Points
This game is scored similar to golf in that a lower score is how one wins.
